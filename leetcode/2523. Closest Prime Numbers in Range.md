# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Sieve algorithm to generate the list of prime numbers within the range [left, right] in O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the range. This will reduce the time complexity of the `get_primes` function from O(m log m) to O(n).

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
To solve this problem, first generate a list of prime numbers within the range [left, right]. Then, iterate through the list and find the pair of prime numbers that satisfies the given conditions and has the minimum difference.

A sieve algorithm works by creating a boolean array of size n + 1, where the index i represents the number i. Initially, all numbers are marked as prime. Then, starting from the first prime number 2, we mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime. We continue this process for all prime numbers up to the square root of n, marking all multiples of each prime number as non-prime. At the end, the remaining unmarked numbers are the prime numbers within the range.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The time complexity of the `get_primes` function is O(n), since it iterates through all numbers in the range and marks the multiples of the prime numbers as non-prime. The time complexity of the `get_pair` function is O(k), where k is the length of the list of prime numbers, since it iterates through the list to find the pair of prime numbers with the minimum difference.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the size of the range [left, right]. The `get_primes` function uses a boolean array of size n to store the prime numbers, and the `get_pair` function stores the list of prime numbers and the result pair, which both contribute to the space complexity.


Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n + k)`, where n is the size of the range and k is the length of the list of prime numbers.
